        <h1>Major Works of Pythagoras</h1>
        <div class="works-content">
            <h2>Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
            <p>Pythagoras is best known for the theorem with his name, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Though the principle may have been known before, Pythagoras is often credited with proving it. It is widely taught in modern mathematics and other branches that deal with numbers.</p>
            
            <h2>Mathematical and Musical Harmony</h2>
            <p>Pythagoras also contributed significantly to understanding the relationship between mathematics and music. He discovered that harmonious musical intervals can be expressed as simple numerical ratios, leading to the belief that numbers underlie the universe's structure.</p>
            
            <h2>Astronomy</h2>
            <p>Pythagoras thought that the Earth was a sphere at the center of the Universe. He also recognized that the orbit of the Moon was inclined to the equator of the Earth, and he was one of the first to realize that Venus as an evening star was the same planet as Venus as a morning star.</p>
